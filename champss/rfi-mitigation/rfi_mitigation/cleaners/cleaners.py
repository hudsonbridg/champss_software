class SpectralKurtosisCleaner(Cleaner):
    """
    This class accepts a spectra and detects RFI corrupted channels by calculating the
    generalized spectral kurtosis (GSK). It is best suited to identification of narrow-
    band impulsive RFI, especially as it uses a median filter approach to remove the
    non-uniform baseline of the GSK statistics in order to detect outliers.

    Here, we discuss some details of the algorithm and choices made in the case of
    CHIME/SPS data. The GSK requires 3 parameters in addition to the intensity data:

    - The scale, `M`, is the number of time samples that are summed together to form the
    GSK estimator. This is notionally 1024, corresponding to ~1 second.

    - The number of onboard integration, `N`, is more precisely described as the number
    of squared Gaussian variates being summed to reach the intensity data.

    - The data distribution shape, denoted as `delta`, is a combination of N and the
    corresponding Gamma distribution shape factor, d, that describes the data.
    Ultimately, it can be considered a "fudge factor" that accounts for arbitrary
    divergences from ideal Gamma distributions (which is the case for quantized data
    and data that is not independent from sample-to-sample).

    Specifically for CHIME/SPS intensity data there are some important details regarding
    the evaluation of N, and ultimately, delta. In an email communication between
    B. Meyers and G. Hellbourg on 2021-03-10:
        - Going from complex voltage data to total intensity involves 4 squared
        samples for each time sample (2 Re/Im and 2 pols).
        - Are you working with coherently or incoherently beamformed data? If it's the
        latter, your N-term would also have to be multiplied by the number of antennas
        summed together. (We are coherently beamforming, thus this factor is 1.)
        - You probably average frequency channels together when you downsample in
        frequency. In that case, you would also have to multiply N by the numbers of
        channels averaged together.

        CHIME/FRB is a slightly special case in that it up-samples the native 1024 L0
        channels to 16384 channels via a FFT method. Specifically, this is described on
        pg. 5 of the system overview paper, which can be found here:
        (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aad188)

        Beamforming occurs after a coarse PFB of 1024 channels. The 1024 x 1024
        beamformed channels are then fed into a fine PFB to increase the frequency
        resolution. The end products are then 1024 x 16k beamformed spectra with 1 ms,
        24.4 kHz resolutions. For each frequency bin of these 16k channel spectra we
        have:

            N = 2 Re/Im * 2 pols * 8 averaged channels * 3 averaged spectra = 96

        If frequency downsampling occurs, you would need to multiply this N by the
        downsample factor. i.e., if we downsampled to 1024 channels, N = 96 * 16 = 1536.

    In terms of estimating the data distribution shape parameters, we are certainly not
    in a regime where analytic values can be used (i.e. delta = 1 if working with
    voltages). To that end, one can estimate the true data shape from the data
    (technically, the first two moments of the data distribution) by selecting a
    typically-good region of the spectrum. For that, we can use the function

        delta = generalised_sk_shape_from_data(
            spec_chunk, good_chan_range[0], good_chan_range[1]
        )

    A more robust approach would be to first flag very clear SK outlier values and
    then compute the median SK estimator value across the full band. We can then
    use this data-driven measurement to rescale the original SK array (rather than
    completely recomputing, which is expensive).
